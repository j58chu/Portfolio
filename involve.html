            Adobe partnered with Amazon to host a designathon focused on inclusive design

                Inspired by Amazon's initiative, your challenge is to design an inclusive experience in a 
                third-party mobile app for high school students looking for opportunities to fulfill community 
                service hours or volunteer to help their local community, no matter what their background or ability.

          <h5>
            Reflecting on when I was a highschool student looking for volunteer hours, I remember that I only 
            volunteered at places where I was familiar with. With limited experiences as a high school student,
             the discoverability of volunteer roles are less prominent than a job search. 
            <p class="red"><b>How Might We??</b></p>
            <p>
                When coming up with some goals and picturing the target audience, I came up with these how
                 might we questions to help brainstorm ideas.

          <h5>Having two brothers in high school also helped with imagining the target user and getting more
             insights to the needs of this user group. Utilising their network of high school students, I was
              able to collect information to curate a typical persona for this product.</h5>

            <p class="red"><b>Considering all user types</b></p>
            <p>
              As I was coming up with a general user group that would be targetted, I also considered the 
              accessibility needs of people with disabilities that may want to use the app as well. I created 
              a chart that outlines all the use cases that I could think of along with their accessibility needs.

        <div>
          <h5>Because of the time limitation, it was crucial to showcase only the key features and functionalities 
            of the product. I ended up designing 5 different functionalities for the app. These functionalities included:
            <ul>
              <li>Being suggested volunteer positions based on location/interest</li>
              <li>View and manage scheduling of volunteer roles</li>
              <li>Search for volunteer roles</li>
              <li>Track hours and customize accessibility settings</li>
              <li>View application progress of applied roles on the app</li>
            </ul>
            Once I figured out the main functionalities of the app, I created a site map to guide myself in designing the flow 
            of the whole app and making sure I made screens for each map component.

            As a part of the creative jam, participants were able to get a mentorship session with an Amazon designer. 
            I got the chance to get  feedback on my designs with one of Amazon's Principal designer, <b>Michele Palazzo</b>. 
            Some of the feedback I took from the session included:
            <ul>
              <li>Have tiles so that users can direct attention to one position at a time</li>
              <li>Adjust search engine to be selective rather than have a type functionality</li>
              <li>Reduce and simplify text to avoid screens being too text heavy</li>
              <li>Reduce onboarding process to only what is considered necessary information</li>

                  Instead of having to input their information manually, students can have their ID scanned
                   to retrieve basic information used to track volunteer hours.

             volunteer more. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to fully flush out the concept in time in which I would have made 
             it a more prominent feature of the app.

                be constantly looking for ways to improve and iterate on my design. I think it is really insightful 
                to be able to see other participant's work and understand their thought processes.
