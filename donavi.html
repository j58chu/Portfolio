        <h2><b>Brief</b></h2>
        <h5>
          Over the summer, I was fortunate enough to be a part of 
          <b class="purple">University of Toronto's Hatchery program NEST</b>. 
          The Hatchery is a program that offers resources and opportunity to launch 
          or further develop startups. 
          <p>My team and I were looking to build a business based on our idea of recommending 
            gifts to people. The idea of Donavi came about when we realised that <b>looking for gifts 
              can be extremely time consuming</b>.<p>With so many websites out there to choose from, the 
                options for gifts are endless. We wanted to simplify the process for those that are 
                looking for a fast and easy way to select the perfect gift.</p>
          </p>
          <p><b>The team</b></p>
          <p>I worked alongside 5 people to create this product. We were a group of students from different educational backgrounds who came together for this project. </p>

      <div class="tab fadeTop">
        <h2><b>Initial Problem Discovery</b></h2>
        <div>
          <h5>The initial idea was discovered when we realized while looking for a gift for one of our friends, there was a lot of back and forth unsureness when it came to figuring out what to get and that it can be quite difficult to think of a gift idea on the spot. Usually when I think about getting a gift for someone, it can take days because there are so many shopping brands online with a bunch of products that it just gets overwhelming and time consuming to choose something.

        <h2><b>User Research</b></h2>
        <div>
          <h5>
             We wanted to first validate our product by conducting user interviews and surveys to gather a wide range of data such as determining who our target demographic is and what people thought was the most frustrating part of gifting. Collectively as a team, we gathered over <b class="purple">200 responses</b> of primary research data. Here were some of the findings:
            <p><b>Interviews</b></p>
            <p>
              We asked users open ended questions to get a better understanding of what their process was like finding a gift for someone. Based on the responses of particpants, we created a survey to help provide more quantitative data to support our theoretical idea of what the gifting journey is like
            </p>

              From our interviews and survey results combined we gathered three key points:

          <img class="img mt mb" src="img/donavi/ujm_donavi.webp" loading="lazy" alt="User Journey Map">
          <h5>I then thought about creating another journey map as a point of comparison of what the customer journey of our platform might look like and how it will tackle the pain points of the gift giving journey.

          <h5>Through research, we also gained a better perspective of who our main user group would be. We found that the group 
            with the most difficulty with finding a gift were men aged 25-35 years of age. Taking what I learnt from research, I put together what I imagined to be our target audience in a persona to make it easily relatable to people and also
             easier to empathize with the user.

            </ul>
            <p>
              The first thing I did was discuss with the team the most necessary features we would need to include on our platform for our MVP. I took our main 
              features and then created a site map of the product so I know what screens I would need to design.

            Throughout the summer, to prep for demo day, startups woud have to pitch their idea to a judging panel for critique. I had the opportunity to present to the panel for 2 of the four pitches. These practice pitches helped us get feedback on content and delivery of our pitch so that it will continually improve. Below is a video of how our most recent pitch went.

        <h2><b>Takeaways</b></h2>
        <h5>
          The Hatchery NEST program was an eye-opening experience into learning more about entrepreneurship and what it takes to create a successful startup. Unfortunately, our team wasn’t able to make it to the final Demo Day pitch, we’ve taken away a lot of skills and will continue to work on building out this project as it is still in its early stages. As the sole UX designer on the team, I was able to make a lot of the design decisions and have a lot of creative freedom. Since we were a small team, we were able to experience areas of expertise outside our own interests. Along with designing the user interface and flow of the web platform, I also had the opportunity to pitch, conduct market research and create graphics. 
          <p class="purple"><b>Here were some of the takeaways from this project:</b></p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <b>Newfound knowledge about building a startup, entrepreneurship and understanding the product cycle from beginning to end.</b>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <b>Importance of identifying a clear problem and target market</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                Coming into the program, our team had a clear idea of what we wanted to create. However, in the beginning stages of our time at NEST, our mentors suggested we re-evaluate our problem and who our target audience is. Our team spent a lot of time conducting primary and secondary research to back up our problem statement which was eventually refined and reciprocated well with the panel of judges when we pitched.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <b>Being adaptive and a team-player</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                b. Being in a start up environment had its ups and downs. Our team faced a lot of critique with our product idea which in return affected the team’s spirits. As a result, nobody was willing to take the initiative to pitch for the last two pitches. I hadn’t planned on presenting our pitches but I offered to take charge and pitch on behalf of the team. I also had to remake the slide decks, design the graphics as presentation prep as well. This experience had taught me to be a better presenter but also to be adaptive in a team environment.
